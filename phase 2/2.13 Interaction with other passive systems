2.13 Interaction With Other Passive Systems
Stacking Effects Without Coupling Risk
Scope Note (Phase-2 discipline)

This section addresses how the Lunar Thermal Blanket interacts with other passive infrastructure already expected at a lunar site.
No system coordination, sequencing, control logic, or dependency chains are assumed.

The core question: can passive systems stack without making each other fragile?

General Principle — Passive Systems Should Superimpose, Not Integrate

Phase-2 assumes all passive systems obey one rule:

Each system modifies boundary conditions locally and independently.

If two systems require awareness of each other, the stack is already broken.

The thermal blanket is treated as a background modifier, not a participant.

Interaction 1 — Regolith Berms, Burial, and Shielding

Stacking behavior:

Berms increase mass and conduction path length

Blanket increases time constant and lateral averaging

Combined effect:

Berm sets depth baseline

Blanket smooths surface forcing before it reaches berm mass

Failure independence:

Loss of berm ≠ loss of blanket benefit

Blanket degradation ≠ berm failure

They reinforce but do not depend on one another.

Interaction 2 — Passive Dust Mitigation (Barriers, Catchers, Wind Screens)

Stacking behavior:

Dust systems modify particle transport

Blanket modifies thermal transport

There is no shared physics loop.

Secondary benefit:

Reduced dust abrasion slows blanket degradation

Blanket does not need dust systems to function

If dust mitigation fails, the blanket continues to operate thermally.

Interaction 3 — Radiation Shielding (Mass-Based)

Stacking behavior:

Radiation shielding is mass-dominated

Thermal blanket is geometry-dominated

Combined effect:

Shared regolith mass benefits both

Blanket does not require specific shielding geometry

The blanket never compromises shielding effectiveness.

Interaction 4 — Passive Thermal Vaults / Regolith Heat Sinks

Stacking behavior:

Vaults store heat

Blanket controls how quickly heat enters or leaves the vault

This is a clean upstream/downstream relationship:

blanket slows external forcing

vault handles internal capacity

There is no feedback loop.

Interaction 5 — MLI and Local Insulation

Stacking behavior:

MLI reduces local radiative exchange

Blanket reduces environmental swing amplitude

This is one of the few intentional stacks.

Important assumption:

MLI failure does not compromise blanket function

Blanket degradation does not compromise MLI safety

Each improves the other’s operating margin.

Interaction 6 — Passive Structural Covers and Debris Shields

Stacking behavior:

Covers block micrometeoroids and debris

Blanket modifies thermal behavior

If combined:

the cover sees harsher thermal gradients

the blanket sees mechanical protection

Neither requires the other to exist.

Interaction 7 — Passive Power Infrastructure (Batteries, Fixed Loads)

Stacking behavior:

Power systems generate waste heat

Blanket moderates the environment into which that heat leaks

No tuning is required.
No assumptions are made about duty cycle or load profile.

The blanket improves tolerance, not efficiency.

What Phase-2 Explicitly Rejects

These are disallowed interactions:

Thermal blanket used as a heat pipe

Blanket required for another system’s survival

Blanket acting as a control element

Blanket needing sensors or coordination

If any system “needs” the blanket, the architecture is wrong.

Degradation Interaction Rule

As any passive system degrades:

total benefit reduces smoothly

no cliff edges appear

no compensatory action is required

If degradation of one passive system forces action in another, the stack has hidden coupling.

Plain-English Summary

The thermal blanket is designed to sit under other passive systems without coordinating with them. Berms, dust barriers, radiation shielding, insulation, and thermal vaults can all stack on top of it. If any one system degrades or fails, the others keep working, just with less benefit. No dependencies, no feedback loops.
