2.14 Phase-2 Synthesis Summary
What Phase-2 Established — and What It Did Not

This section closes Phase-2 by locking what is now true at the theory level and explicitly bounding what remains unproven. It is a checksum, not a sales pitch.

What Phase-2 Established (Theory-Level)

Phase-2 supports the following conclusions without requiring execution:

The thermal problem is time-domain, not setpoint-domain
Lunar batteries and electronics are stressed primarily by rate and amplitude of temperature cycling, not by absolute temperature alone.

A passive, geometry-based layer can meaningfully reshape thermal behavior
By increasing path length, lateral averaging, and effective thermal mass, a blanket-style structure can slow thermal propagation from the surface to subsurface assets.

Area is a more powerful long-term lever than depth
Once diurnal effects are damped, expanding lateral area continues to increase thermal time constants, while additional depth yields diminishing returns.

The blanket works by damping, not insulating
It does not attempt to seal heat in or out. It intentionally remains leaky, avoiding both cold-soak and heat-trap failure modes.

Battery coupling relies on time-constant separation, not control
The battery’s own thermal mass dominates once environmental forcing is slowed sufficiently. No direct thermal interface is required.

The concept degrades gracefully
Mechanical damage, dust accumulation, settling, and embrittlement reduce benefit gradually rather than causing abrupt failure.

Perimeter and over-asset placement solve different but compatible problems
Local protection and site-level averaging are both valid and can stack without interaction risk.

Passive systems can stack without coupling or coordination
The blanket modifies boundary conditions and does not participate in system control, enabling safe coexistence with berms, shielding, MLI, vaults, and dust mitigation.

What Phase-2 Explicitly Did Not Establish

Phase-2 does not claim:

Quantitative performance numbers

Temperature setpoints or limits

Battery life extension percentages

Material selections or construction methods

Installation procedures

Site-specific feasibility

Cost, schedule, or mass optimization

Certification or safety approval pathways

All of the above are execution-phase concerns.

What Would Move This Out of Phase-2

The theory is complete enough to justify asking execution questions, but not answering them.

Advancing requires:

physical modeling or testing

site-specific assumptions

material behavior validation

coupling measurements

operational risk tradeoffs

Those actions are intentionally outside Phase-2 scope.

Phase-2 Pass / Fail Statement

At the theory level, the Lunar Thermal Blanket:

plausibly increases thermal time constants

plausibly reduces temperature swing amplitude

does not introduce new catastrophic failure modes

remains infrastructure-grade and passive

If any of those are false in practice, the concept should be discarded rather than patched.

Phase-2 Handoff Boundary

Phase-2 hands off questions, not answers:

How large is “large enough”?

How leaky is “leaky enough”?

Which sites benefit meaningfully?

Where does heat rejection dominate?

What materials survive longest?

Those questions define Phase-3.

Plain-English Summary

Phase-2 shows that a wide, passive thermal blanket can plausibly slow how fast lunar heat swings reach buried batteries, reducing stress without controlling temperature or adding complexity. It establishes why the idea could work and how it fails, but intentionally avoids claiming numbers or build details, leaving those decisions to execution phases.
