Phase 2 — Core Thermal Theory Expansion
Lunar Thermal Blanket
2.1 Fundamental Physical Model (Why This Works)

The Lunar Thermal Blanket operates by exploiting three facts that are already true on the Moon and do not require control, power, or feedback:

Vacuum eliminates convection
Heat transfer is dominated by radiation and conduction only.

Regolith is a poor thermal conductor
Once buried, temperature gradients propagate slowly and predictably.

Diurnal thermal cycling is extreme but shallow
Large surface swings do not fully penetrate depth on mission-relevant timescales.

The blanket is not a heater, cooler, or regulator.
It is a geometry-based thermal impedance layer.

2.2 Thermal Role of the Blanket (What It Actually Does)

The blanket introduces a controlled, passive modification to heat flow by:

Increasing radiative path length between surface and subsurface

Increasing effective thermal mass seen by the protected asset

Reducing thermal swing amplitude transmitted downward

Delaying phase lag of day/night temperature fronts

This converts fast, high-amplitude surface cycling into slow, low-amplitude subsurface variation.

Nothing is stabilized.
Everything is slowed and damped.

2.3 Why This Is Different From “Just Bury It”

Direct burial couples hardware tightly to regolith temperature gradients.

The blanket creates a buffer zone:

Upper layer absorbs and re-radiates surface flux

Lower interface sees averaged, delayed thermal input

Hardware experiences a narrower operating band

This matters because battery degradation and electronics stress scale with cycle amplitude, not just absolute temperature.

The system trades depth for time-domain smoothing.

2.4 Time-Constant Framing (Order-of-Magnitude)

Phase 2 does not claim numeric performance, but the qualitative behavior is robust:

Surface thermal cycle: hours

Shallow regolith response: days

Blanket-modified response: weeks+

Battery core response: months

The blanket does not “hold heat.”
It slows heat flow enough that downstream thermal mass can dominate.

2.5 Failure Behavior (Phase 2 Perspective)

Important: Phase-2 failure modes are benign.

Blanket torn → system reverts toward baseline burial behavior

Partial coverage → asymmetric damping, not runaway

Dust accumulation → slightly improves insulation

Settling/compaction → increases thermal contact, usually beneficial

There is no mode where the blanket causes thermal runaway or catastrophic overheating.

Worst case: it stops helping.

2.6 Why Passive Beats Active Here

Active thermal systems fail loudly and demand attention.

This system:

Has no control loops

Has no sensors

Has no power dependency

Has no operational states

It cannot oscillate, misconfigure, or drift out of calibration.

The blanket behaves like infrastructure, not equipment.

Plain-English Summary (Phase-2 Checksum)

The Lunar Thermal Blanket works by slowing how fast heat moves between the lunar surface and buried hardware. By inserting a passive thermal buffer, it reduces temperature swings without controlling temperature, lowering stress on batteries and electronics over long durations. If it fails, it simply stops helping.
