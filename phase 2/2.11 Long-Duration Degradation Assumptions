Scope Note (Phase-2 discipline)

This section assumes years to decades of exposure with no maintenance, no inspection, no intervention.
We are not optimizing performance retention — we are bounding how bad degradation can get without breaking the premise.

Assumption 1 — Degradation Is Monotonic and Slow

The blanket is assumed to degrade in one direction only:

no self-healing

no regeneration

no active correction

But degradation is slow relative to thermal time constants.

If degradation happens on:

days → that’s a failure

months → probably unacceptable

years → acceptable

decades → ideal

Anything slower than the lunar diurnal cycle preserves the damping benefit.

Assumption 2 — Mechanical Damage Does Not Equal Thermal Failure

Tears, fraying, punctures, or edge damage are expected over time.

Phase-2 assumption:

mechanical integrity ≠ thermal usefulness

partial coverage still provides proportional benefit

thermal impedance is area-averaged, not point-sensitive

A blanket that looks “wrecked” can still be thermally effective.

Assumption 3 — Dust Accumulation Is Neutral-to-Beneficial

Dust deposition is assumed to:

increase effective thickness

reduce radiative coupling

increase surface roughness

Worst-case assumption:

optical properties drift unpredictably

but bulk thermal behavior trends toward more regolith-like

That is not catastrophic.
That is convergence toward baseline insulation.

Assumption 4 — UV, Radiation, and Thermal Cycling Cause Gradual Embrittlement

Material properties may degrade due to:

UV exposure

radiation damage

repeated thermal cycling

Phase-2 assumption:

embrittlement leads to cracking, not vaporization

fragments remain in place

no sudden loss of bulk coverage

Failure mode is fragmentation, not disappearance.

Assumption 5 — Settling and Compaction Increase Conductive Contact Over Time

Over long durations:

blanket settles

voids close

regolith contact increases

This reduces the peak benefit but does not invert it.

The blanket slowly transitions from:

engineered impedance layer
to
“enhanced regolith layer”

That’s degradation, not reversal.

Assumption 6 — No Sharp Performance Cliff Exists

There is assumed to be no single-point degradation threshold where the system abruptly stops helping.

Performance curve is assumed to be:

continuous

smooth

downward sloping

If a cliff exists, the concept is brittle and fails Phase-2 logic.

Assumption 7 — End State Is Baseline, Not Worse-Than-Baseline

Crucial assumption:

At end of life, the site behaves like:

ordinary burial

dust-covered regolith

shallow subsurface

It must never become thermally worse than having done nothing.

If the end state is worse than baseline, the system violates infrastructure principles.

Time-Horizon Framing (Non-Numeric)

Phase-2 assumes:

benefit is front-loaded in early years

value decays slowly

replacement is optional, not required

The system is allowed to “age out” quietly.

Failure Interpretation

If long-duration degradation:

creates new hazards

increases thermal cycling

requires removal

demands monitoring

Then the system was misclassified — it was equipment, not infrastructure.

Plain-English Summary

Over long periods, the thermal blanket is expected to tear, settle, and get dusty. That should slowly reduce its benefit, not flip it into a problem. Even badly degraded, it should behave like extra regolith — helping less, not hurting. If it ever makes things worse or needs upkeep, the idea fails.
