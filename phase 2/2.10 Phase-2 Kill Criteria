2.10 Phase-2 Kill Criteria
How This Theory Could Be Wrong

Phase 2 is theory-only. So kill criteria here are falsifiers: conditions that, if true, mean the Lunar Thermal Blanket does not deliver its core claimed effect (time-domain damping of thermal swings) or creates unacceptable side effects.

No hero narratives. Just failure conditions.

K1 — Regolith Thermal Conductivity Is Too High in Practice

What would kill it:
If the local regolith acts like a good conductor (e.g., unexpectedly high solid contact, rockier-than-assumed matrix, cemented layer, or sintered crust) such that heat moves quickly downward, then the blanket cannot meaningfully slow thermal propagation.

Symptom:
Buried temperature tracks surface changes too quickly (little phase lag, little damping).

Interpretation:
The “regolith is a good insulator” assumption fails at that site.

K2 — The Blanket Cannot Maintain a Stable Low-Conductance Layer

What would kill it:
If the blanket geometry collapses into intimate contact everywhere (compaction, settling, burial pressure, or fabric collapse), turning it into just another conduction path with no meaningful impedance.

Symptom:
Thermal response becomes indistinguishable from “shallow burial without a blanket.”

Interpretation:
The blanket stops being a thermal structure and becomes dead mass.

K3 — Radiative Exchange Dominates and the Blanket Doesn’t Change It

What would kill it:
If most thermal forcing is radiative in a way the blanket does not intercept (e.g., direct line-of-sight heating into a cavity, or re-radiation from nearby hot structures), then changing regolith conduction paths won’t matter.

Symptom:
Subsurface temps swing because radiation is driving them, not conduction.

Interpretation:
Wrong dominant heat-transfer mechanism for the installation geometry.

K4 — Local Topography/Wind/Dust Creates Non-Stationary Boundary Conditions

What would kill it:
If the environment around the blanket changes fast enough (scouring, drifting, berm formation, partial uncovering, repeated burial/unburial) that the boundary condition is not slow and predictable.

Symptom:
Thermal performance is unstable over time, with step-changes larger than the damping benefit.

Interpretation:
The “slow trends” assumption is invalid because the site is dynamically reshaping itself.

K5 — The System Accidentally Becomes a Heat Trap for the Battery

What would kill it:
If the blanket reduces heat rejection enough that internal dissipation raises battery temperatures into a damaging regime.

This is the one “silent failure” you don’t get to ignore.

Symptom:
Battery steady-state temperature rises above acceptable limits during long sun exposure or continuous operation.

Interpretation:
The “leaky by design” assumption is wrong for that configuration; heat rejection path is insufficient.

K6 — The Damping Benefit Is Too Small to Matter for Battery Life

What would kill it:
Even if physics works, if the reduction in cycle amplitude is so small that it doesn’t move degradation rates meaningfully, then it’s not worth fielding as infrastructure.

Symptom:
Measured/derived cycle amplitude reduction is negligible relative to battery tolerance band.

Interpretation:
Correct-but-pointless. The concept fails on value, not physics.

K7 — Installation Adds Complexity That Breaks the “Infrastructure” Claim

What would kill it:
If the blanket requires precise placement, active maintenance, periodic re-tensioning, or anything that creates a recurring operational burden.

Symptom:
It becomes “equipment” with a maintenance schedule.

Interpretation:
Even if thermal benefit exists, it violates the core premise (passive, ignorable, permanent-ish).

K8 — Dust Accumulation Produces Adverse Optical/Thermal Behavior

What would kill it:
If dust deposition changes absorptivity/emissivity in a way that consistently worsens temperature extremes instead of damping them (e.g., the blanket becomes a better absorber and heats subsurface more than expected).

Symptom:
Hot-case gets hotter, cold-case doesn’t improve, net swing does not reduce.

Interpretation:
Surface radiative properties drift in the wrong direction.

Minimal Phase-2 “Pass Condition” (Non-Numeric)

For the theory to survive into later phases, the blanket must plausibly achieve all of the following:

Increase thermal time constant of the buried zone (more lag, slower response)

Reduce temperature swing amplitude at the battery location

Avoid creating a hot-case heat-trap

Remain “infrastructure-grade” (no recurring operations)

If any one of those is false, Phase-2 should be considered failed.

Plain-English Summary

This concept is wrong if the local regolith conducts heat too well, if the blanket can’t hold a low-conductance layer, if radiation dominates in ways the blanket can’t block, or if site changes bury/unbury it unpredictably. It also fails if it traps battery heat, if the benefit is too small to matter, or if it needs maintenance and stops being passive infrastructure.
