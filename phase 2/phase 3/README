Phase 3 — Commercialization & Execution
Purpose of Phase 3

Phase 3 defines commercial execution, monetization, and deployment rights for the Lunar Thermal Blanket system.

All content prior to Phase 3 (Phases 0–2) is provided as open technical reference under the Phase 2 license.
Phase 3 is the point at which commercial use begins and licensing is required.

No technical claims, performance guarantees, or execution authority are granted outside this phase.

Relationship to Phase 2 License

The Phase 2 license permits:

Reading, sharing, and referencing the material

Internal analysis and evaluation

Non-commercial research, modeling, and discussion

Prototyping and testing that does not result in operational deployment or commercial benefit

The Phase 2 license automatically terminates upon commercialization.

Phase 3 exists to define:

When commercialization occurs

What actions require a license

How execution rights are granted

Definition of Commercialization

Commercialization includes, but is not limited to:

Manufacturing hardware intended for operational use

Deployment in any paid, funded, or contracted program

Use in customer deliverables, bids, proposals, or funded demonstrations

Internal use that produces commercial, contractual, or operational value

Integration into a product, platform, service, or mission architecture

Sale, lease, or licensing of derivative systems

Use by or on behalf of a commercial entity, government contractor, or funded program

Commercialization does not require revenue to have occurred — intent and use are sufficient.

Non-Commercial Use (Still Allowed Without Phase 3)

The following do not constitute commercialization:

Academic discussion or citation

Internal technical review or education

Unfunded concept studies

Non-operational lab experiments

Private evaluation without deployment or contractual use

If there is ambiguity, assume Phase 3 applies.

Execution Rights

Execution rights are not granted under Phases 0–2.

Execution rights are granted only via a Phase 3 commercial license and include:

Authorization to manufacture

Authorization to deploy

Authorization to integrate into operational systems

Authorization to sell or provide services using the system

Execution without a Phase 3 license is unauthorized use.

Commercial License Structure

Commercial execution requires a signed Phase 3 license agreement.

Baseline license terms (indicative):

Flat-fee commercial license

Fee tiered by organization size and use case

Optional exclusivity available by separate agreement

No royalty unless explicitly negotiated

Exact pricing and terms are defined in the executed license agreement, not in this repository.

Enforcement and Intent

This repository is published to enable propagation and technical clarity, not to grant free execution rights.

Phase separation is intentional:

Phases 0–2 lower adoption friction

Phase 3 cleanly defines the commercial boundary

Use beyond Phase 2 without a Phase 3 license constitutes unauthorized commercial use.

Organizations intending to commercialize, deploy, or execute this system should initiate a Phase 3 license discussion prior to execution.
