2.8 Battery Coupling Assumptions
Scope Note (Phase-2 Discipline)

This section defines assumptions about thermal coupling, not hardware design.
No interfaces, no fasteners, no layouts, no build steps.

The goal is to bound how the Lunar Thermal Blanket interacts thermally with batteries, not how to build it.

Assumption 1 — Indirect, Passive Coupling Only

The Lunar Thermal Blanket does not directly heat or cool the battery.

Thermal interaction occurs only through:

Regolith conduction

Structural conduction already present

Radiative exchange inside buried cavities (if any)

There is no:

Active heat routing

Controlled thermal straps

Switchable interfaces

If the blanket is removed, the battery still functions exactly as it would under normal burial or surface conditions.

Assumption 2 — Battery Is the Dominant Local Thermal Mass

Batteries (especially multi-cell packs) possess:

High volumetric heat capacity

Slow internal temperature equalization

Strong resistance to rapid temperature change

The blanket’s job is not to control battery temperature, but to ensure that the external thermal environment varies slowly enough for the battery’s own thermal mass to dominate.

The system relies on time-constant separation, not regulation.

Assumption 3 — Coupling Is Always “Leaky,” by Design

Perfect insulation is neither achievable nor desirable.

Phase-2 assumes:

Continuous, low-rate heat leakage in both directions

No attempt to create a thermal “lock” or sealed envelope

Temperature drifts are inevitable and acceptable

This prevents:

Heat buildup during prolonged sun exposure

Cold soak during extended eclipse

Thermal runaway due to trapped internal dissipation

The system behaves like a damped reservoir, not a thermos.

Assumption 4 — Symmetry Is Helpful but Not Required

Ideal coupling is roughly symmetric around the battery, but:

Partial blanket coverage still provides benefit

Asymmetric placement leads to directional gradients, not instability

Lunar surface conditions are already asymmetric; the blanket does not introduce a new failure class

The design does not assume perfect placement or alignment.

Assumption 5 — Blanket Improves Rate, Not Setpoint

The blanket does not enforce a target temperature.

Instead, it:

Reduces peak heating rates

Reduces peak cooling rates

Narrows temperature swing amplitude

Increases phase lag between surface forcing and battery response

Battery temperature still tracks environmental trends — just more slowly and gently.

Assumption 6 — Battery Internal Heat Is Beneficial

Normal battery operation generates waste heat.

Phase-2 assumes:

Internal dissipation slightly biases temperature upward

The blanket helps retain this heat during cold periods

The same leakiness allows excess heat to escape during hot periods

This passive bias improves survivability without control logic.

Assumption 7 — Coupling Does Not Require Battery Modification

The concept assumes:

No changes to battery chemistry

No changes to pack architecture

No custom thermal interfaces required

Any battery that already tolerates burial or partial shielding benefits from reduced environmental cycling.

This keeps the blanket infrastructure-level, not component-level.

Failure Perspective

If coupling assumptions are violated:

The blanket simply becomes less effective

Battery behavior reverts toward baseline

No new catastrophic modes are introduced

There is no dependency chain.

Plain-English Summary

The thermal blanket doesn’t connect directly to the battery or try to control its temperature. It just makes the environment around the battery change more slowly, letting the battery’s own thermal mass do the work. If the coupling isn’t perfect, nothing breaks — the system just helps less.
