2.7 Scaling Logic — Area vs. Depth Trade
Core Claim (Phase-2 Framing)

For passive thermal damping on the Moon, lateral area beats burial depth once a minimum coupling depth is reached.

Depth helps first.
Area helps forever.

Why Depth Saturates

Burial depth improves thermal stability by increasing the path length for heat conduction through regolith. But this effect saturates:

The lunar diurnal thermal wave only penetrates so far

Below that depth, additional burial mostly adds mass, not isolation

Deeper burial yields diminishing returns per centimeter

Once hardware is past the dominant thermal skin depth, adding more depth buys very little additional smoothing.

At that point, you are paying mass and excavation cost for marginal benefit.

Why Area Continues to Scale

The blanket changes the problem from vertical insulation to lateral averaging.

Increasing blanket area:

Intercepts a larger fraction of incident radiative flux

Forces heat to spread laterally before moving downward

Increases effective thermal inertia seen by the buried system

Lengthens the thermal time constant without increasing burial depth

In other words:
Area increases the number of thermal paths, not just their length.

The Trade in Practical Terms

Think of two extremes:

Case A — Deep, Small Footprint

Strong local insulation

High vertical gradients

Fast response to localized surface changes

Case B — Shallow, Wide Blanket

Moderate insulation

Large averaging volume

Slow response to any single surface condition

For long-duration hardware survival, Case B is usually superior.

Scaling Rule of Thumb (Non-Numeric)

Phase-2 rule (qualitative, not a spec):

Use depth to get past the dominant diurnal influence

Use area to control long-term thermal stability

Stop increasing depth once daily cycling is already damped

Keep increasing area if you want longer time constants

The blanket exists specifically to make area a viable lever.

Interaction With Hardware Thermal Mass

As area increases:

The blanket’s effective thermal mass grows

Downstream batteries and structures see smoother input

Hardware thermal mass becomes dominant over surface forcing

At sufficient area, the system behaves as if it is operating in a quasi-subsurface environment even when burial depth is modest.

Failure and Degradation Implications

Area-based scaling fails gracefully:

Partial coverage loss reduces benefit proportionally

Uneven settling introduces asymmetry, not instability

Dust accumulation does not negate area effects

Depth-based scaling fails abruptly if burial is compromised.
Area-based scaling does not.

Why This Matters for Deployment Philosophy

This logic supports:

Thin, wide blankets over deep trenches

Incremental expansion over one-shot excavation

Retrofit capability around existing assets

Compatibility with manual or robotic placement

The system scales by laying more blanket, not digging deeper holes.

Plain-English Summary

After a certain point, burying hardware deeper doesn’t help much. Spreading the thermal blanket wider keeps slowing heat flow and makes temperature changes gentler over time. For passive lunar systems, area is the better long-term lever than depth.
