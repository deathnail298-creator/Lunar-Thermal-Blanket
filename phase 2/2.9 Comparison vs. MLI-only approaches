2.9 Comparison vs. MLI-Only Approaches
What “MLI-only” is actually doing

MLI (multi-layer insulation) is optimized to reduce radiative heat transfer between a protected object and its surroundings. In vacuum, that’s a big lever.

So an MLI-only strategy is basically:

wrap the thing

cut radiative exchange

hope internal mass + whatever conduction paths remain are enough

That can work for specific components, but it has hard limits as infrastructure.

Why MLI-only is not the same as the Lunar Thermal Blanket
1) MLI is component insulation; the blanket is environmental reshaping

MLI-only: isolates the hardware from the environment.

Thermal blanket: changes the environment’s time behavior (slows surface forcing before it reaches the hardware).

If you remove the MLI, you lose most of the effect.
If you remove the blanket, you still have normal burial behavior — the blanket is additive, not required.

2) MLI-only is fragile; the blanket is tolerant

MLI performance depends on maintaining:

layer spacing

low compression

clean surfaces

intact outer layers

On the Moon, those are not guaranteed forever.

The thermal blanket approach assumes:

dust accumulation

abrasion

partial burial

tears and settling

Worst case: it slowly becomes “more like regolith,” which is still an insulating medium. That’s graceful degradation.

3) MLI-only can trap heat; the blanket is intentionally leaky

MLI can be so good at suppressing radiation that internally generated heat becomes hard to reject unless you add:

radiators

conduction paths

deliberate thermal straps

So MLI-only can accidentally create a “thermal bottle.”

The blanket approach is built around leaky damping:

it slows heat flow

but does not try to seal it

it can’t easily create runaway heat trapping because the bulk medium is regolith and the surface remains a sink via radiation

In short: blanket = damper, not thermos.

4) MLI-only scales poorly as “site infrastructure”

To scale MLI-only you typically scale by:

wrapping more hardware

adding more bespoke installations

That becomes a maintenance/installation story.

The blanket scales by:

laying more area

broadening the stabilized zone

It’s site-level infrastructure, not per-component treatment.

5) MLI-only doesn’t address conduction through mounts and regolith contact

Even with perfect MLI:

anything mechanically mounted conducts

anything touching regolith conducts

cables and structural attachments conduct

So MLI-only often ends up fighting conduction you can’t realistically eliminate.

The blanket embraces conduction and uses it:

it shapes the conduction path through regolith

it converts fast cycling into slow trends before the hardware ever sees it

Where MLI-only is better

MLI-only wins when:

you have a small, isolated component

you can control geometry and keep it intact

you need strong reduction in radiative exchange immediately

you can manage heat rejection separately

So MLI isn’t “bad.” It’s just not the same class of solution.

Best-practice relationship (Phase-2 framing)

The correct mental model is:

MLI is local insulation

Thermal blanket is environmental conditioning

They can stack:

battery pack can still use MLI locally

blanket reduces the external forcing that MLI would otherwise have to fight

But the blanket remains meaningful even if MLI is absent or degraded.

Plain-English Summary

MLI wraps hardware to reduce radiation, but it’s delicate, doesn’t scale as site infrastructure, and can trap heat if you’re not careful. The lunar thermal blanket doesn’t rely on perfect layers; it reshapes the ground thermal environment by slowing heat flow through regolith. MLI can help locally, but the blanket is the bigger “environmental damper” play.
