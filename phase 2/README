Phase 2 — Theory & Analytical Expansion
Lunar Thermal Blanket
Purpose

Phase 2 exists to deepen understanding of the Lunar Thermal Blanket through theory, reasoning, and analytical framing.
This phase explores why the concept works, where its margins come from, and how it behaves across environments — without authorizing construction, testing, or deployment.

Phase 2 does not advance TRL.
It reduces uncertainty for readers deciding whether execution is worth pursuing.

Phase Discipline & License Notice

Phase 2 materials are governed by a theory-only license that explicitly prohibits execution without a separate execution license, defined in Phase 3.

Reading Phase 2 is permitted.
Executing Phase 2 content is not.

Phase 0 and Phase 1 rights remain unchanged and are not expanded by this material.

What Phase 2 Contains

Phase 2 materials may include:

Thermal reasoning and envelope analysis

Order-of-magnitude calculations

Boundary-condition exploration (lunar day/night, burial depth, regolith properties)

Failure-mode extrapolation beyond Phase 1

Scaling logic and deployment geometry discussion

Comparative framing versus active thermal systems

All content remains theoretical and non-operational.

What Phase 2 Explicitly Does Not Contain

Phase 2 intentionally excludes:

Build instructions or fabrication steps

Test procedures or validation plans

Simulation for the purpose of implementation

Performance guarantees or claims

Costed hardware designs

Certification pathways

Any activity that looks like execution belongs in Phase 3 and requires a separate execution license.

Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0: Establishes permission-to-exist and problem framing

Phase 1: Defines bounded, testable prototype scope

Phase 2: Explains theory and reasoning without execution

Phase 3: Governs execution permission, cost, and deployment logic

Each phase is legally and operationally independent.

Intended Audience

Engineers evaluating conceptual soundness

Program managers assessing technical risk

Reviewers deciding whether execution is justified

Executives seeking technical clarity without committing resources

This phase is not written for builders.

Use Rules (Plain Language)

You may:

Read and critique the material

Discuss it internally

Use it to inform decision-making

You may not:

Build from it

Test from it

Simulate for implementation

Include it in proposals or contracts

Execution requires Phase 3 authorization.
