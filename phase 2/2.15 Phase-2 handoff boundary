2.15 Phase-2 Handoff Boundary
What Phase-3 Is Allowed to Do — and What It Is Not

This section is the hard wall between theory and execution.
It exists to prevent Phase-2 reasoning from quietly mutating into build authority.

What Phase-2 Officially Hands Off

Phase-2 hands off questions, constraints, and failure logic, not designs.

Specifically, Phase-3 is permitted to receive:

Identified dominant heat-transfer mechanisms

Validated conceptual levers (area, depth, time constant, leakiness)

Kill criteria and falsifiers

Degradation expectations and end-state assumptions

Placement mode distinctions (perimeter vs over-asset)

Non-claims and architectural invariants

These define the search space Phase-3 may operate in.

What Phase-3 Is Explicitly Allowed to Do

Once authorized, Phase-3 may:

Choose specific materials and geometries

Assign dimensions, thicknesses, and coverage areas

Perform simulations for implementation purposes

Build and test physical articles

Generate performance numbers and limits

Explore site-specific deployment logic

Evaluate cost, mass, and logistics

Interface with certification and safety processes

All of this is forbidden in Phase-2 and legal only with execution authority.

What Phase-3 Is Explicitly Not Allowed to Do

Phase-3 may not:

Rewrite Phase-2 premises retroactively

Remove kill criteria without evidence

Convert damping into regulation or control

Introduce active elements “for convenience”

Create hidden dependencies on the blanket

Claim Phase-2 guarantees or promises

Back-propagate execution results into Phase-2 as facts

If execution contradicts theory, theory wins until formally revised.

Phase-2 Freeze Rules

Upon handoff:

Phase-2 text becomes read-only

No numbers are inserted

No diagrams are upgraded into instructions

No “minor clarifications” that add authority

Phase-2 remains a historical reasoning record, not a living design.

Failure Handling Across the Boundary

If Phase-3 execution finds:

kill criteria are met → terminate concept

assumptions violated → document and stop

benefit too small → discard, do not optimize

Patch-by-complexity is disallowed.

A failed passive concept should be abandoned, not rescued.

Why This Boundary Exists

Without a hard boundary:

theory becomes marketing

execution becomes justified by narrative

risk is hidden instead of surfaced

The boundary forces honesty:

Either physics carries the idea, or it dies.

Phase-2 Exit Statement

Phase-2 is now complete.

It has:

defined the problem in time-domain terms

identified passive levers that plausibly address it

enumerated how the idea could fail

constrained execution behavior in advance

Everything beyond this point is execution.

Plain-English Summary

Phase-2 ends by clearly separating thinking from building. It hands Phase-3 a set of questions, limits, and failure rules, but no permission to construct anything. If testing later proves the theory wrong or the benefit too small, the idea should be dropped rather than complicated.
