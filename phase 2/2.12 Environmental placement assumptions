2.12 Environmental Placement Assumptions
Perimeter vs. Over-Asset Deployment
Scope Note (Phase-2 discipline)

This section addresses where the Lunar Thermal Blanket sits relative to assets and why placement changes system behavior.
It does not prescribe layouts, dimensions, anchoring, or installation steps.

Two Distinct Placement Modes

Phase-2 recognizes two valid, non-exclusive placement strategies:

Over-Asset Placement — blanket directly above or around the protected hardware

Perimeter Placement — blanket positioned upstream or around an operational zone

These modes are not interchangeable; they change the thermal problem being solved.

Over-Asset Placement — Direct Damping

What it does:

Intercepts surface thermal forcing immediately above the asset

Shortens the conduction path between blanket and hardware

Maximizes local thermal damping efficiency per unit area

Assumptions:

The dominant heat transfer path is vertical

Asset location is known and static

Local modification is acceptable

Behavior:

Strong local swing reduction

Faster response to blanket degradation

Performance tied closely to coverage integrity

Failure posture:

Loss of coverage reduces benefit locally

Still reverts toward baseline burial, not worse

This mode behaves like targeted thermal conditioning.

Perimeter Placement — Environmental Averaging

What it does:

Shapes the thermal environment before it reaches assets

Forces heat to propagate laterally through regolith

Converts localized surface extremes into averaged subsurface trends

Assumptions:

Assets experience heat indirectly through the surrounding ground

The site thermal field is spatially coupled

Long-term stability matters more than peak suppression

Behavior:

Weaker per-area effect

Larger effective thermal mass

Slower, smoother temperature evolution

Failure posture:

Partial loss reduces benefit proportionally

No single-point sensitivity

This mode behaves like site-level thermal inertia, not asset protection.

Comparative Trade (Phase-2 framing)
Aspect	Over-Asset	Perimeter
Primary effect	Local damping	Environmental averaging
Sensitivity	Higher	Lower
Coverage precision	Helpful	Unimportant
Degradation impact	Faster to notice	Slower, diffuse
Infrastructure feel	Component-adjacent	Site-level

Neither is “better” universally. They solve different problems.

Hybrid Assumption (Most Realistic)

Phase-2 assumes hybrid placement is viable and natural:

Over-asset blankets protect critical components

Perimeter blankets smooth the broader environment

Effects stack without interaction complexity

Because everything is passive, overlapping influence zones do not destabilize each other.

Interaction With Other Systems

Perimeter placement:

stacks well with dust mitigation

benefits multiple assets simultaneously

reduces spatial thermal gradients

Over-asset placement:

pairs well with local MLI

targets high-value or fragile components

requires less total area for the same local effect

Phase-2 assumes both can coexist without coordination.

Kill-Condition Reminder

Placement assumptions fail if:

the thermal field is too decoupled spatially (no lateral averaging)

localized radiation dominates over conduction

site reshapes itself faster than thermal trends

Those cases are already covered in 2.10.

Plain-English Summary

Putting the blanket directly over hardware gives strong local protection but depends on good coverage. Putting it around the perimeter changes the ground’s overall thermal behavior and is more tolerant of damage. In practice, using both lets you smooth the environment and protect key assets without creating new dependencies.
