# Executive / Contractor Appendix

## Lunar Thermal Blanket — Phase 1 to Production Outlook

This appendix is written for **executives, program managers, and contractors** evaluating the Lunar Thermal Blanket as a candidate for Phase 1 execution and eventual production. It summarizes **time, cost, and scale expectations** without committing to procurement terms.

This appendix is **informational**, not a proposal or pricing offer.

---

## 1. Scope and Intent

All values in this appendix are **rough-order-of-magnitude estimates** intended to support planning and internal decision-making.

---

## 2. Phase Definitions (For Clarity)

* **Phase 1:** Ground-based validation, thermal-vacuum testing, design refinement
* **Phase 2 (Implicit):** Flight design finalization, qualification testing, manufacturing setup
* **Production:** Repeated fabrication of standardized units

This appendix assumes Phase 0 is complete (reference architecture locked).

---

## 3. Timeline: Phase 1 to Production-Ready

**Estimated Total Duration:** **15–24 months**

This represents the expected elapsed time from the start of Phase 1 validation through a production‑ready, flight‑qualified design.

---

### Phase 2 / Flight Readiness (Implicit)

**Estimated Duration:** 9–15 months

Includes:

* Final design selection
* Environmental qualification testing
* Manufacturing process definition
* Documentation and reviews

---

### Total Time: Phase 1 → Production-Ready

**Estimated Total:** **15–24 months**

This assumes:

* No fundamental physics surprises
* Standard test facility access
* Conventional materials and processes

---

## 4. Total Development Cost (Phase 1 → Production)

**Estimated Range:** **$1.1M – $2.5M**

This represents the combined development cost required to progress from Phase 1 validation to a production-ready design. Values are rough-order-of-magnitude estimates and include contingency.

---

### Phase 2 / Qualification Cost (ROM)

**Estimated Range:** **$750k – $1.8M**

Primary cost drivers:

* Qualification testing
* Design iteration
* Manufacturing setup and tooling

---

### Total Development Cost (Phase 1 → Production)

**Estimated Range:** **$1.1M – $2.5M**

This range reflects conservative planning and includes contingency.

---

## 7. Risk Posture

Key reasons cost and schedule risk are controlled:

* Passive design
* Known materials
* Known physics
* No software or active control loops

The primary risk remains **test availability**, not technical feasibility.

---

## 8. Executive Summary (One-Paragraph Version)

> The Lunar Thermal Blanket is a low-complexity, passive surface infrastructure asset. From Phase 1 through production readiness is expected to take approximately 15–24 months at a total development cost of roughly $1–2.5M. Once standardized, per-unit fabrication costs are expected to fall in the low-thousands of dollars, excluding locally sourced regolith. The system scales by replication, not complexity, and carries limited technical risk.
