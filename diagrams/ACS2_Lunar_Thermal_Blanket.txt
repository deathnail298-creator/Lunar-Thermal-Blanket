ACS2 — Lunar Thermal Blanket Topology

PURPOSE

* Passive surface infrastructure asset that increases effective thermal resistance between a thermal reservoir (battery/hardware enclosure) and the lunar environment.

NOTES

* No moving parts required for steady-state operation.
* Dust is benign or beneficial.
* Regolith is the primary insulating medium.

NODES

ENVIRONMENTAL

* SUN: Solar input (daytime)
* RADIATIVE_SKY: Radiative sink (nighttime view to space)
* SURFACE_REGOLITH_FIELD: Local regolith terrain surrounding asset

INFRASTRUCTURE ASSET

* BLANKET_BODY: Structural blanket layer defining geometry and supporting regolith coverage
* EDGE_SKIRT: Geometry feature reducing line-of-sight radiation and edge losses
* REGOLITH_LAYER: Regolith coverage on/over blanket (primary insulation)

PROTECTED SYSTEM

* THERMAL_RESERVOIR: Battery enclosure / hardware enclosure + attached thermal mass
* THERMAL_INTERFACE_PLATE: Passive conduction plate/strap coupling reservoir to insulated region

GROUND INTERFACE

* INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE: Region beneath blanket/regolith with reduced thermal exchange to environment
* SUBSURFACE: Deeper regolith/ground thermal mass below near-surface layer

EDGES (PRIMARY)

DAYTIME HEAT PATHS

* SUN → BLANKET_BODY (absorbed/incident radiation)
* SUN → REGOLITH_LAYER (absorbed/incident radiation)
* BLANKET_BODY → REGOLITH_LAYER (conduction/contact)
* REGOLITH_LAYER → INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE (conduction)
* INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE ↔ SUBSURFACE (diffusion)

NIGHTTIME HEAT LOSS PATHS

* THERMAL_RESERVOIR → THERMAL_INTERFACE_PLATE (passive conduction)
* THERMAL_INTERFACE_PLATE → INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE (conduction)
* INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE → SUBSURFACE (diffusion)
* BLANKET_BODY → RADIATIVE_SKY (reduced radiation via geometry)
* REGOLITH_LAYER → RADIATIVE_SKY (radiation from top surface)

EDGE/LEAK PATHS

* INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE → SURFACE_REGOLITH_FIELD (lateral conduction)
* EDGE_SKIRT → RADIATIVE_SKY (residual edge radiation)

---

CONTROL/INTERFACE NOTES

* No electrical interfaces required.
* No data interfaces required.
* Integration is thermal only:

  * THERMAL_RESERVOIR coupled via THERMAL_INTERFACE_PLATE/straps to INSULATED_GROUND_ZONE.

FAILURE-RESILIENCE ANNOTATIONS

* Partial blanket displacement increases edge losses (EDGE/LEAK PATHS) but does not eliminate insulation effect.
* Puncture/perforation of BLANKET_BODY is non-catastrophic; REGOLITH_LAYER remains dominant.
* Dust accumulation increases REGOLITH_LAYER thickness and typically improves insulation.

CANONICAL DEMONSTRATOR

* One blanket unit protecting one thermal reservoir ("one blanket, one battery").
* Performance measured by τ_gain and Δt_survival relative to baseline.
