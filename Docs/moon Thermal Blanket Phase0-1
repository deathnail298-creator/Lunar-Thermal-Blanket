# Lunar Thermal Blanket

## Phase 0 / Phase 1 Reference Architecture

---

## 1. Purpose

The Lunar Thermal Blanket is a **passive surface infrastructure asset** designed to moderate extreme lunar day/night thermal swings for surface batteries and small hardware enclosures. It is not a heater, generator, or active thermal control system.

The system exploits known lunar regolith thermophysical behavior in vacuum to increase effective thermal resistance between a protected thermal reservoir and the lunar environment.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Lunar surface systems experience:

* Extreme temperature swings across lunar day/night cycles
* Long-duration nights (~14 Earth days at many sites)
* Severe radiative heat loss at night
* Risk of daytime overheating

Active thermal control increases system complexity, mass, power draw, and failure modes. A passive solution that improves thermal time constants is valuable even if it does not eliminate the need for all active measures.

## 3. Design Philosophy

* Passive only (no moving parts, no software dependency)
* Dust-tolerant by design
* One-time deployment
* Scales by repetition, not complexity
* Uses known materials and physics

This system is framed as **infrastructure packaging**, not as a novel physical effect.

## 4. Phase 0 Concept Overview

### 4.1 What the System Is

A surface-deployed insulating blanket using lunar regolith as the primary insulating medium, optionally augmented by a radiant barrier layer, placed over and around a localized thermal reservoir.

### 4.2 What the System Is Not

* Not a heater
* Not a power source
* Not a cryocooler
* Not a habitat
* Not dust-sensitive
* Not maintenance-dependent

## 5. Reference Architecture (Phase 0)

### 5.1 Subsystems

**BLANKET_BODY**
Structural layer supporting regolith coverage and defining geometry.

**REGOLITH_LAYER**
Native lunar regolith acting as primary insulation.

**THERMAL_RESERVOIR**
Battery or hardware enclosure augmented with passive thermal mass.

**THERMAL_INTERFACE_PLATE**
Passive conductive plate or straps coupling reservoir to insulated region.

**GROUND_INTERFACE**
Non-precision regolith contact; improves over time through settling.

## 6. Operating Behavior

**Daytime:**

* Reduces solar-driven heat penetration
* Limits peak reservoir temperature

**Nighttime:**

* Increases effective thermal resistance
* Slows radiative and conductive heat loss

**Dust:**

* No cleaning required
* Additional dust increases insulation thickness

## 7. Phase 0 Thermal Model (Minimal)

The system is modeled as a first-order thermal RC network:

* Thermal capacitance C: battery + attached thermal mass
* Effective thermal resistance R_eff: dominated by regolith blanket

Time constant:

τ = R_eff × C

Temperature evolution:

T(t) = T_env + (T0 − T_env) · exp(−t / τ)

## 8. Phase 1 Objectives

Phase 1 converts the reference concept into a testable engineering system.

* Define requirements and metrics
* Upgrade thermal modeling fidelity
* Build and test prototype variants
* Retire key risks through measurement
