# Cost, Mass, and Scalability

This document provides a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) assessment of mass, cost, and scalability for the Lunar Thermal Blanket. Values are intended for Phase 0 / Phase 1 planning and are not procurement commitments.

---

## 1. Cost Philosophy

* Emphasize simplicity over optimization
* Minimize delivered mass
* Avoid precision components and active systems
* Scale by replication, not by complexity

The Lunar Thermal Blanket is intended to be treated as **surface infrastructure**, not bespoke flight hardware.

---

## 2. Delivered Mass Budget (Per Unit)

Delivered mass excludes locally sourced regolith.

**Blanket Structure:**

* Structural fabric / sheet: 1–3 kg
* Optional radiant underlayer: 0.5–1.5 kg
* Edge skirt / reinforcement: 0.5–1 kg

**Thermal Interface Hardware:**

* Passive conduction plate or straps: 1–3 kg

**Total Delivered Mass:**

* **~3–8 kg per unit**

---

## 3. Area and Performance Scaling

Representative footprint ranges:

* R1 (small): ~2–4 m²
* R2 (medium, baseline): ~5–10 m²
* R3 (large): ~10–25 m²

Thermal performance scales primarily with:

* Blanket area
* Regolith thickness
* Edge-loss geometry

No single scaling parameter dominates.

---

## 4. Cost Drivers

Primary cost drivers include:

* Blanket material fabrication
* Integration labor
* Environmental testing and validation

There are no long-lead electronics, precision mechanisms, or software development costs.

---

## 5. Rough Order-of-Magnitude Costs

**Phase 1 Prototype Units:**

* Fabrication and integration: low five figures (USD)
* Test costs dominated by shared thermal-vacuum chamber time

**Flight-Equivalent Units (Production):**

* Unit cost expected to be low relative to active thermal systems
* Cost decreases with repetition and standardization

The concept is compatible with:

* CLPS-class payload economics
* Incremental infrastructure deployment

---

## 6. Scalability Model

The system scales by **replication**:

* Each blanket protects a single asset or enclosure
* No cross-coupling between units
* Failure or degradation of one unit does not affect others

This enables:

* Incremental deployment
* Mixed-vendor usage
* Gradual infrastructure buildup

---

## 7. Value Proposition Summary

The Lunar Thermal Blanket trades:

* A small amount of delivered mass
* For persistent reduction in thermal risk
* With minimal operational burden

It is most valuable when used to:

* Extend survival margins
* Reduce active thermal power demand
* Simplify battery thermal design

---

## Status

Supports:

* Phase 0 reference architecture
* Phase 1 programmatic evaluation
